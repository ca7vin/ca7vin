  <p>I finally found a job that I love...

That's what I tell myself today, as I come to the end of my training as a developer at Molengeek.

After having studied computer graphics for 3 years in Namur, during which I learned the basic principles of graphic design, digital printing and the necessary tools (Adobe suite in particular), I decided to study in communication.

In 2020, I graduate with honors but very quickly I realize that I don't know which job to turn to. I miss the graphics but I need to try something new. I remember thinking back to my studies in Namur, regretting not having chosen an option more oriented towards the web and programming.

Gradually, in my spare time, I decided to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and JS. And very quickly, I find it fascinating because the possibilities are enormous. I then decided to register at Molengeek to deepen my knowledge, challenge myself and seriously consider my professional future.

Today, I finally know where I'm going and I'm thirsty to learn and evolve.</p>
